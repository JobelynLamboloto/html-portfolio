    It is about a group of young friends that witness supernatural forces and secret government exploits.

<h3>The Space Between Us</h3>
<p>This movie is an American Romantic Science Fiction Film directed by Peter Chelsom and written by Allan Loeb.
    Gardner Elliot, the first human born on Mars, begins an online friendship with Tulsa, a teen in Colorado.
    On his maiden voyage to Earth, he finally gets to experience all the joys and wonders of the world he could only
    read about. But they discover that Gardner's organs can't withstand the atmosphere on Earth. The interplanetary
    visitor races against time to unravel the mysteries of how he came to be, and where he belongs in the universe.
    This is a good movie, I would personally recommend it to teenagers.</p>
<h3>Matilda The Musical</h3>
<p>This movie is a musical fantasy comedy drama film directed by Matthew Warchus. It's about a young girl named Matilda
    Wormwood, who has an incredible intellect and magic powers, including the ability to levitate objects. She is a
    lover
    of books, and can read stories meant for adults by the age of four. Her clear intelligence goes unnoticed by her
    uncaring family, who often treat her badly. I'd recommend mostly this for kids, it is fun to watch.
