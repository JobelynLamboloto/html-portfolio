<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Jobelyn Lamboloto, a graduate of BS in Electronics Engineering and a recent passer of the electronics engineering licensure examination.
  Currently, I am looking for my first job that really suits me and my pasion. During my academic year, I've acquired knowledge and skills in various
  electronics communication equipment and also basic programming and troubleshooting skills. I may not have enough working experience, but I can give 
  my very best to fulfill my responsibilities properly especially with the help of your company. I am very willing to learn and develop new skills. 
  I am reliable and dependable and able to listen effectively when solving problems. I have an active and dynamic approach to work and getting things 
  done. I hope to find an employer sooner that I can help reach their goals as well as help me learn and grow professionally. 
</p>

<p>In my free time, I used to play badminton, ride a bike, sleeping, watching movies and of course coding. I also love to sing on our church, play an 
  acoustic and bass guitar but I'm not a professional artist, I just really love music. As of now, I am enrolled in a coding bootcamp and so far I really
  enjoyed learning from them. I love learning new things and I was looking forward to improve more of my coding skills in the end of the bootcamp.
  That is all, thank you!
</p>
